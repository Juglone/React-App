# React-App

This is my first React App! It was made for a school project. To view the website in your browser, run `npm start` in the terminal. Then it will open up a localhost in your browser.

I mainly used [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A) and [this react documentation](https://reactjs.org/) to learn the fundamentals of react. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
